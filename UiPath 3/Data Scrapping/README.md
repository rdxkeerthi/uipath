
# UIPath RPA Project :  Data Scrapping Automation

In an era where efficiency and accuracy are paramount, organizations are increasingly turning to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions to streamline their workflows. One such endeavor involves leveraging UIPath, a leading RPA platform, to automate the extraction of data from both standard text-based PDF files and image-based PDFs utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

This UIPath RPA project is tailored to address the challenge of extracting valuable information from diverse sources efficiently and reliably. The primary objective is to develop a cohesive automation solution that not only reads text from conventional PDF documents but also handles the complexities of image-based PDFs through OCR capabilities. 




## Demo

[Tutorial](#)


## Instruction

Open `Scrapping.xaml` and run the project on Uipath

```bash
 `Scrapping.xaml`
```

Note : Make sure you have `Image.pdf` and `text.pdf` in Side the main folder if you are doing it manually otherwise i have provided it.
## Aim

####  Evaluateing the effectiveness and efficiency of screen scraping techniques by extracting structured data from unstructured sources.



## Features

- Input Acquisition: The automation process begins with the acquisition of PDF files, which may include both text-based and image-based documents. These files are sourced from various channels such as emails, file repositories, or designated folders.
- PDF Parsing and Text Extraction: For text-based PDFs, the automation mechanism utilizes UIPath's built-in functionalities to parse the document structure and extract relevant textual content. This phase involves techniques for navigating through the PDF document, identifying text elements, and extracting the required data fields with precision.
- OCR Integration for Image-based PDFs: In cases where the PDF contains scanned images or non-searchable text, OCR technology comes into play. UIPath's OCR capabilities are leveraged to convert the image-based content into machine-readable text. Through intelligent OCR algorithms, the automation solution accurately interprets the textual information embedded within images, ensuring no data is overlooked.
- Data Validation and Quality Assurance: Once the text extraction process is completed, the automation workflow includes mechanisms for data validation and quality assurance. This stage involves comparing the extracted data against predefined validation rules or reference datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.


## Conclusion:
By implementing this UIPath RPA project for PDF text and image OCR scrapping automation, organizations can achieve significant improvements in productivity, accuracy, and compliance across their data extraction processes. Moreover, by reducing manual intervention and error rates, the automation solution empowers employees to focus on value-added tasks, driving overall business growth and innovation.
