In this UIPath RPA project, we aim to automate the process of fetching weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, from a browser and importing it into an Excel file. This automation streamlines the manual task of gathering weather information, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.




## Instruction

Open `Main.xaml` and run the project on Uipath

```bash
 `Main.xaml`
```

Note : Make Sure you have MS Excel 2010 or above. 
    


#### Implementing a script that interacts with external data sources (e.g., Excel, databases) during the automation process.



## Features

- Time Savings: By automating the manual task of fetching weather data from the browser and importing it into Excel, the project significantly reduces the time and effort required for this process.
- Accuracy and Consistency: Automation ensures consistent data retrieval and eliminates human errors that may occur during manual data entry.
- Scalability: The automation can be easily scaled to handle multiple locations, time intervals, or additional weather parameters as needed, without increasing the workload on human operators.
- Resource Optimization: With repetitive tasks automated, human resources can be allocated to more value-added activities, enhancing overall productivity.
